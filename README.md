# ACPower Sound
Plays a sound whenever the AC state changes, when you plug or unplug your laptop, all in a single source file.

## Configuration
Change the necessary defines in the source file.

## Lite
The \*-lite source file is for testing, it runs once and plays a sound depending of your current AC state instead of watching for state changes.
